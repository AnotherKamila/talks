# Make yourself at home

* make yourself a user, get a nice shell
  * root shell is `csh`
  * `pkg install bash` or `zsh` or `fish` or ...
  * `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/something`
  * reminder: `sh` is really `sh`!
* get an editor
  * `pkg install vim` or `emacs` or ...
  * reminder: `vi` is really `vi`!
* `pkg install sudo`
  * add yourself to group `wheel` (**not** `sudo`)

---

# Make yourself at home

* CLI utilities (coreutils) are slightly different
  * most are easy to get used to
  * if you need GNU versions: `pkg install coreutils` and use them with a `g` prefix: `gfind`, `ggrep`...
  * but you probably don't
* notably `make` is very different
  * you probably want `pkg install gmake`
  * `make` is BSD make, `gmake` is GNU make
* [GNU vs BSD commands reference](#TODO)
