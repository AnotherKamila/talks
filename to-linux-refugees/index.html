# The Battle Plan

1. Make yourself at home
   * Hello, FreeBSD!
2. System Administration Basics
   * where to look
3. Solving the Problem
   * a look at 3 different possible causes and how FreeBSD helps us solve them

# Make yourself at home

???

```
pw useradd -n kamila -m
pkg install fish
chsh -s fish kamila
pkg install vim
pkg install sudo
pw usermod -n kamila -G wheel
```

--

* make yourself a user, get a nice shell
  * `man pw`
  * `pkg install bash` or `zsh` or `fish` or ...
  * `chsh -s fish user`
  * reminder: `sh` is really `sh`!
* get an editor
  * `pkg install vim` or `emacs` or ...
  * reminder: `vi` is really `vi`!
* `pkg install sudo; visudo`
  * add yourself to group `wheel`

---

# Make yourself at home

* CLI utilities (coreutils and such) are slightly different
  * most are easy to get used to
  * if you need GNU versions: `pkg install coreutils` and use them with a `g` prefix: `gfind`, `ggrep`...
  * also `pkg install gtar` or other `g`-things
* notably `make` is very different
  * you probably want `pkg install gmake`
  * Linux vs BSD commands ref TBA soon<sup>TM</sup>

# Where to Look

* `ps` and other basic system utilities are more or less the same
  * `netstat -l` is called `sockstat -l`
* `/etc/rc.conf` has services
* use `service foo start` and such

# .center[# #1]

???

```
man hier
find the config file
man zfs, /snapshot
note snapdir
zfs get snapdir zroot
try: zfs set snapdir=shown zroot, note that it tells you what you need
zfs set snapdir=visible zroot
cd /.zfs/snapshot (now we have it!)
find . -name nginx.conf | xargs grep 'location'
cp ./daily-2018-10-16/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
service nginx start
```

--

* `man hier` tells you what is where
* packaged stuff goes to `/usr/local`, including `/usr/local/etc`

--

* files overwritten / corrupted / eaten by a squirrel: ZFS to the rescue!
* `man zfs`, search for snapshot
* can rollback everything, or mount `.zfs/snapshot` and just copy the good file

---

# .center[# #2]

???

BEFORE: `service pf start`

--

* firewall on FreeBSD: pf
* `man pf.conf` explains the config file syntax
* `man pf` has some general info about pf
* an advanced firewall with some awesome features such as very nice logging — more details later

---

# .center[# #3]

???

```
cat /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf, note the lua -- or will nginx tell us?
cd /usr/ports/*/nginx
make config
make install
```

--

* **ports** are the "recipes" for building software for FreeBSD
    * look for them in `/usr/ports/<topic>/<program>`
* packages are just pre-built ports
* you can use ports to change how things are built
    * e.g. `make config`
* in reality, you would usually not use `make install` directly, but a helper such as `portmaster`, `synth` or `poudriere`
